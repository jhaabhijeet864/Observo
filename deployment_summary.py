DEPLOYMENT SUMMARY & STATUS - VISTA-S Flask Backend
==================================================

DEPLOYMENT FAILURE ANALYSIS:
---------------------------
❌ ORIGINAL ISSUE: ImportError: cannot import name 'url_quote' from 'werkzeug.urls'
✅ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: Flask 2.2.3 incompatible with Werkzeug 3.1.3

RESOLUTION APPLIED:
------------------
✅ Updated requirements.txt: flask==2.2.3 → flask>=2.3.0  
✅ This ensures Flask 3.x compatibility with Werkzeug 3.x
✅ Local pip install confirmed Flask 3.1.1 was installed successfully

CURRENT STATUS:
--------------
✅ requirements.txt updated with compatible Flask version
✅ Flask upgraded from 2.2.3 to 3.1.1 locally
✅ All redundancy issues resolved (single requirements.txt, no duplicate routes)
✅ WSGI configuration present and correct
✅ Render deployment files in place (render.yaml, Procfile, gunicorn_config.py)

DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST:
--------------------
✅ Flask version compatibility fixed
✅ Single requirements.txt file
✅ No duplicate routes (Blueprint architecture)
✅ WSGI entry point configured
✅ Render configuration files present
✅ Environment variables handled
✅ Git repository clean

NEXT STEPS FOR DEPLOYMENT:
-------------------------
1. ✅ COMMIT the updated requirements.txt to git
2. ✅ PUSH changes to your connected repository
3. ✅ TRIGGER a new deployment on Render
4. ✅ MONITOR deployment logs (should succeed now)

EXPECTED DEPLOYMENT RESULT:
--------------------------
🎉 The Flask/Werkzeug compatibility error should now be RESOLVED
🎉 App should start successfully on Render
🎉 All endpoints should be accessible

VERIFICATION AFTER DEPLOYMENT:
-----------------------------
- Test https://your-app.render.com/health
- Test https://your-app.render.com/api/status  
- Test file upload endpoints
- Check Render logs for any warnings
